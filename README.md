# Bash-Scripting-Suite-for-System-Maintenance
This Bash script is my System Maintenance Menu, which helps me easily handle different system tasks from one place. It lets me run a backup, perform system updates and cleaning, and check logs for errors using separate scripts. It keeps everything organized and simple to use.
